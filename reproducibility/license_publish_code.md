If your code is a derivative code, you need to check the license of the original code.
You may need to contact the authors to ask for permission to use the code if a license is not available.

## Add a license to your code

You can add a license to your code by adding a file called `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt` to the root of your repository.
If your repository is incorporating multiple licenses, you can add a `LICENSE` folder.

[License templates](https://reuse.software/faq/#license-templates) can be found and used in your code.

## Publish your code

You can publish your code in a repository in a public repository hosting service such as GitHub.
Anyway you may want to add a persistent identifier to your code.
Services such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) allow you to create a DOI for your code.

## Make your code citable

You can make your code citable by adding a `CITATION.cff` file to the root of your repository.
This file can be used to generate a citation for your code.
You can use the [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) to create the file.
